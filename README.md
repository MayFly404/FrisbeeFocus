##  Overview

FrisbeeFocus is a web application that enables users to submit frisbee throw videos, which it analyzes and provides nuanced AI-generated feedback. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 model, the application offers actionable, personalized advice, integrating varied context like throw type and weather conditions. The app ensures environment and build consistency, integrates robust logging features, and maintains user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing UI.

| [main.py](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/main.py)                   | This script controls a web application that communicates with a remote server via SSH. It utilizes Flask for the web aspect, Paramiko for SSH communication, and openai for AI-related functionalities. The app can send commands to the remote server and includes robust logging features. It also manages an uploads directory and secures OpenAI API credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [replit.nix](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/replit.nix)             | The replit.nix file in the repository is responsible for managing system-level dependencies. It helps ensure that necessary libraries (libGLU, libGL, openssh) are pre-installed on the server, thus providing environment consistency across different deployment stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [poetry.lock](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/poetry.lock)           | The poetry.lock file in this repository is critical for dependency management. It freezes the project's Python dependencies, ensuring consistent and predictable builds by locking each package to a specific version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [main (copy).py](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/main (copy).py)     | This code forms the core of a Flask application that receives a video of a frisbee throw via an API endpoint, extracts frames from the video, and analyzes them. After the frame analysis, the system utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate a natural language feedback based on frame summaries and additional context like weather and throw type. This feedback then gets sent back to the client as a response. The critical feature accomplished here is leveraging an AI model to provide actionable, user-friendly feedback about user-uploaded videos. |
| [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/pyproject.toml)     | This `pyproject.toml` file serves as a configuration file for the python project. It outlines key metadata about the project such as its name, version, and author. More notably, it specifies the project dependencies and associated versions, like Flask and OpenAI. Additionally, it configures the build system and Python linting preferences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MayFly404/FrisbeeFocus/blob/master/requirements.txt) | The requirements.txt file lists the Python dependencies required by the project. It specifies packages like Flask for web server capabilities, Jinja2 for HTML templating, and requests for HTTP requests management, crucial for the application's functionality following the repository's architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
